## Intro

- "Hey, I'm Seeker :) Let's talk about pixel art today !"
- "I feel like when talking about pixel-art, we often see it as an end to a mean, or focus too much on the pixel part. I wanted to focus more on the art part, but we're still gonna cover the basics."
- "Just to be clear, this isn't a pixel-art tutorial, this is an overview of pixel-art as an art form."
- "Once this video is over, I hope that you will understand and appreciate pixel-art a little bit more !"

### Vocab

- Let's define some importants words first.
- The pixel-artist is the artist behind the pixel-art. Amazing, I know.
- The pixel is the basic building block of pixel-art. That was in the name after all. Pixels are square most of time, and have a specific color.
- The canvas is our available space for drawing pixels. The canvas size is called Resolution, written width by height, here five by four.
- The sprite is a drawing made with pixels on a canvas. The term is mostly used in game development.
- The palette is the list of colors used on a sprite
  - Palettes can be created from "top-down" : they are defined in advance and sprites are restricted to theses colors, or created "bottom-up" : they are defined from all the color in a sprite after it has been drawn.
  - Additionally, you can categorize palettes with their colors : monochromatic palettes have multiples shades of one colors, like the game boy palette on the right, or polychromatic, like the EDG-8 on the left."

## Definition (max 3 min)

- Now, let's define pixel-art ! First, is pixel-art a medium for painting or it's own art form ? What do you think ?...
- To be honest, this debate has been going on for years, and no clear answers has emerged. My own personal opinion is ever-changing.
- Secondly, how do we clearly define what is or isn't pixel-art ? Do not even bother, it was also a trap. No consensus have been reached on this topic either, and it probably never will.
- These questions are really fascinating to think and discuss, but I haven't got the time for that. I put a few link in description if you are interested about them.
- However, even if the details are heavily debated, there's a general consensus that pixel-art stand on two pillars. Constraint Breed Creativity and Every Pixel Matter. Thoses two are in symbiosis and feed each other : constraints allow you to pay attention to each pixel, and the fact that each pixel is important and has meaning will constraints you, especially if you have to draw something in a limited time.

### Every pixel matter

- Let's review Every Pixel Matter. This principle state that every pixel should be intentional. You can interpret this in a variety of way, and my take is that pixel-art is about being intentional with everything, and emphasize a total control of the pixel-artist over their creation, down to the smallest thing.
- As a consequence of this principle, a single pixel can change our perception of a painting. Let's look at this adorable dolphin, originaly pixelled by Frannek. If you add a few pixel here and there, the shape of the dolphin will change accordingly.

### Constraints breeds creativity

- Now, it's time to talk about Constraints Breeds Creativity. The concept is simple : constraining yourself will push you to be more creative to circumvent thoses constraints. Since everyone will work around theses constraints differently, theses will lead to the developpement of personal artistic style.
- Pixel-Art achieve this by playing with 2 levers : Color Palette Size and Canvas Size.
- Most pixel-artists will limit themselves to a few colors, with palettes often ranging between 2 to 64 colors.
- Canvas Size will be limited to a small size. Having a smaller resolution will force you to be more abstract and to give up on some less important details. If you want to delve deeper, a good way to study this is to look at the evolution of some classical sprites, like Mario or Megaman.

## Histoire (max 1 minute)

- Let's replace pixel-art within art history !
- For starters, pixel-art is the modern blending and evolution of three art form : Romain mosaic, Cross Stitch and the Pointillism movement.
- Pixel-art's father is ASCII art. "Painting" software didn't exist yet and drawing images on website was too costly on bandwith, so we drew images with text characters.

### Timeline

- Pixel Art is highly linked to the technological developement of computers.
- In the 70s up to the mid 90s, gaming started with arcade, and pixel-art wasn't called pixel-art, but "computer graphics". At the time, it was the only possible way of reprensenting things on a screen at the time. This period is often called the Golden Age of pixel-art, as it was the dominant digital art form.
  - Donkey Kong Sprites : https://www.mariouniverse.com/sprites-nes-dk/
- In the 90s, the technical progress brought a halt to mainstream pixel-art, starting the Dark Ages of Pixel-Art. Pixel-art was still being drawn, but started to have competition : computers started to be powerful enough so that pixel art wasn't the only option anymore. Digital drawing started to emerge, and in gaming especially, 3D graphics became the norm of most of the mainstream productions, and they still haven't looked back.
- In the mid to late 00s (thousands ?), indie studios especially started to consider pixel-art again, not as a technical limitation, but as a legitimate and deliberate choice. In 2012 with the succes of FEZ, Pixel-art became more and more seen by the general audience as a legitimate option. Fez and 2012 can be seen as a milestone marking the end of the Pixel-Art Renaissance and the start of Modern Pixel-Art.

## Interaction avec la technologie (2 min)

- Pixel-Art has an intimate relationship with technology, and today I want to focus on one specific interaction, being the difference between displaying pixel-art on a CRT TV vs on a LCD screen.

### CRT vs LCD

- CRT TV use a different way of drawing pictures than LCD monitors : while LCD draw every pixel individually once each frames, CRT use scanlines : an full horizontal line is drawn, then another, then another...
- Due to this difference in display technology, pixels on CRT aren't perfect squares, and have a tendency to "bleed" on other neighboring pixels, blending the colors. Pay attention to Dracula's eye especially.
- Does this mean that pixel-art is better on CRT ? Well... Yes, No, Maybe ? I don't know. Just keep in mind that sharp pixels didn't exist before the 00's, and that old pixel-art should be looked at on a CRT for an authentic viewing experience. CRT Pixels on Twitter is a really good follow if this topic interest you !

## Modern Pixel-Art and Conclusion (2 min)

- It is now time to talk about modern pixel-art. I will show you a few artworks by some of my favorite artists, just for pleasure. Let's pay attention here to the two pillars and see how the pixel-artists play with them.
- The first artwork is mine. I choose to use only 2 colors, and have a relatively small canvas. 2-colors palettes are called 1Bit. 1Bit artworks simply their color to focus on constrast, shapes and textures. Only using two colors give the final picture an elegant and "clean" finish, similar to minimalist art.
  - https://twitter.com/BSSeekerPixels
- The artist here is using a greyscale palette, which keep the minimalist and elegant vibe. This is balanced with an huge canvas, giving them a lot of space to play with light and shadow.
  - https://twitter.com/CamiUnknown
- In the same vibe as the two before, we keep a low color count and the canvas is sized for a portrait, letting the artist draw details like the fold in the clothing or strands of hair flowing. The blue color is used to accent and differenciate a few details. The use of dithering is really important in 1bit, as it is our way of bypassing the restriction of only using 2 colors. White and Black will blend together to create a gradient.

- Now, a reprensentation of a Minecraft house. The color palette is small, and colors are applied in "blob", meaning that every pixel is connected to at least another pixel of the same color. This help create a cohesive and really sharp look to the painting. Pixels not connected to any other pixels of the same color are called "Orphan Pixels"
  - https://twitter.com/RoyalNaym
- Sky and Clouds particularly are one of art favorite subject, and pixel-art is no exception. Sharp, simple blobs and very bright colors for the cloud constrast a lot with the nightly background, which make use of anti-aliasing, giving the stars a blurry and blendy look with the sky.

- From the same artist, another cloud. This one make use of a lot of anti-aliasing to blend the different part of the cloud together, and adding this to a monochromatic palette, give the impression of brushstroke and painting.

- Every piece so far has been a static artwork, but this is comming straight out of a video game : Blasphemous Two. The palette and canvas start to get really big, leaving the artist the space it needs to paint this entrance to a temple. The combination of a big palette and canvas size allow to draw details. Look at the veins of the hands, the swirling of the beard or the texture of the bricks.

- Before we progress any further, the next image contains artistic nudity. Skip to the next chapter if needed.
- This image is pixel-art, even if it's hard to tell at a glance. The constraints of palette and canvas size are almost gone. If we zoom in, we can actually see that the picture make use of all the previous techniques. Dithering at this resolution will create an almost perfect color gradient once zoomed out. The anti-aliasing will soften every edges, making the transition between the women, her cloth piece and the background seamless.

## Rules are made to be broken

- As the last 2 pieces demonstrated, stretching the rules can create amazing art. If we break them, we can even go even further, and pixel-art is no exception.

- If we transgress the concept of the pixel, go back to our ASCII roots while keeping the color of pixel-art, we get Text-Mode, or Text-Art. Here, we put text-characters instead of pixels to draw.

- If we trangress the very concept of the canvas, add a dimension, and transform pixels into cubes, we get Voxel-Art.

## Conclusion

- I want to thank you for watching until the end. I hope you enjoyed your time with me and learned a few things. Of course, every artists and sources used is available alongside the script of this video in description. There is so much more to talk, but for today goodbye, and see you next time !
